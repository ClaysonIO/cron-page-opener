# Open the Page

My kids like to watch cartoons on Saturday mornings. We don't want to wake up to turn on the TV, but we don't want them to accidentally open up an inapproriate show while we're still asleep. So I created this tool to open up a random show that they like each Saturday at 7am.

## Scheduling Functionality

This project includes functionality to open pages on a schedule using cron expressions. The scheduling functionality is implemented using the `cron-parser` library. Users can specify a cron expression to define the schedule, and the application will open the specified pages based on that schedule.

## Fully Client-Side

This project is fully client-side, utilizing React, TypeScript, and Vite. All the scheduling and page opening functionality is handled on the client side without any server-side components.

## Created Using Claude via Cline and Github's Copilot

This project was created entirely using Anthropic's Claude 3.5 via Cline and Github's Copilot feature. This project was built as an experiment and a way to learn a new tool.
